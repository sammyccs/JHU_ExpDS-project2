#2.Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

#  Reading Data 
NEI <- readRDS("./summarySCC_PM25.rds")
 
# Sampling data for testing
NEIsample <- NEI[sample(nrow(NEI), size = 5000, replace = F), ]

# Subsetting data and appending two years into one data frame
MD <- subset(NEI, fips == '24510')
